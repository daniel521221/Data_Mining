## What is pair coding?
Peer programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (a screen, keyboard, and mouse between the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "controller", the other, is also actively involved in the programming task, but is more focused on the general direction is the "browser"; Programmers are expected to switch roles every few minutes or so.

## Common mistakes

Both schedulers must actively participate in the task during a paired session; otherwise, no benefit can be expected.
A simplistic but often raised objection is that matching "doubles the costs"; That's a misconception based on equating programming with typing; However, one should keep in mind that this is the worst result of a badly applied pairing. It is expected that at least the driver, and possibly both programmers, will keep an active comment; Pair programming is also "programming out loud": if the driver is silent, the navigator must intervene.
Partner programming cannot be fruitfully imposed on people, especially if problems get in the way of relationships, including the more mundane ones (like personal hygiene); solve these first!

## Good practices in pair coding
In practice, this is usually a collaboration between two developers with different degrees of experience: thus, a more experienced worker can pass on their knowledge to their younger colleagues directly through practice. For their part, a younger worker may come up with other ideas, perhaps more innovative, that they can contribute to the project.

Likewise, a mix of workers from different industries can also be quite beneficial: if an old-school programmer collaborates with a designer, the combination of their experiences can be quite helpful for both.


## Expected benefits
Higher code quality: "Program out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the intricacies and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of errors or falling into dead ends.
Better dissemination of knowledge among the team: particularly when a developer who is not familiar with a component is paired with one who knows it much better.
Better Skills Transfer: As junior developers acquire micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members.
Great reduction in coordination efforts: as there are N / 2 pairs to coordinate instead of N individual developers.
Greater resilience of a peer to interruptions: Compared to an individual developer: When one member of the peer must heed an external prompt, the other can remain focused on the task and can help regain focus afterwards
