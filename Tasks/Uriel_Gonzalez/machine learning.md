# Machine Learning

## What is machine learning?
The main goal of Machine Learning (ML) is to develop systems that can autonomously change your behavior based on your experience. ML offers some of the most effective techniques for discovering knowledge (patterns) in large volumes of data. ML can play an important role in a wide range of critical applications such as data mining, natural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems. AM provides possible solutions in all of these domains and more. It is also created to be a pillar of our future civilization.


## Where is machine learning used?
Machine learning techniques have become an important subject of study in computer science due to both their profound theoretical implications as well as the applicability of these techniques to solving real-life problems. ML has played a fundamental role in areas such as bioinformatics, information retrieval on the web, business intelligence and the development of autonomous vehicles.




## What is linear regression for?
The simple linear regression forecast is an optimal model for demand patterns with a trend (increasing or decreasing), that is, patterns that present a linear relationship between demand and time.
There are measures of the intensity of the relationship presented by the variables that are essential to determine when it is convenient to use linear regression.
When it comes to an independent variable, the functional form that is most used in practice is the linear relationship. The regression analysis then determines the intensity between the variables through correlation and determination coefficients.

## Simple linear regression analysis
Visualization of graph 1
In the first linear regression graph of the training data, which is 20, the "x" axis is the years of experience and the "y" is the salaries, the slope that estimates the average the rate of change between these two and The points would be our real data, as can be seen, the data is not so far from the slope, since it is a positive linear regression, the salary tends to increase for each unit of years of experience that increases, for example the one with 7.1 years of experience and win 98,273 is a little above average since it slightly touches the line.

Visualization of graph 2
In this graph is the test data that is 10, it is observed in the graph that it is of positive linear regression and the same is applied as to the previous one, the salary increases if the years of experience increase. On the slope of the average salary with the years of experience, most of the points are far from the average, for example the data of 9 years of experience earns 105,582 but is below the average so you should earn more money for your years from experience.
