## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning consists of a discipline of computer science, related to the development of Artificial Intelligence, and that serves, as already mentioned, to create systems that can learn by themselves.

It is a technology that allows a series of operations to be made automatic in order to reduce the need for human beings to intervene. This can be a great advantage when it comes to controlling a huge amount of information in a much more effective way.

What is learned is called the system's ability to identify a large series of patterns selected by a large number of parameters.

That is, the machine does not learn by itself, but rather an algorithm of its programming, which is modified with the constant input of data into the interface, and which can, in this way, predict future scenarios or take actions automatically according to certain terms. As these actions are performed autonomously by the system, it is said that learning is automatic, without human intervention.

### How does Machine Learning work?

In classical computing, the only way to get a computer system to do something was by writing an algorithm that defined the context and details of each action.

On the other hand, the algorithms used in the development of Machine Learning carry out a good part of these actions on their own. They obtain their own calculations based on the data that is collected in the system, and the more data they obtain, the better and more accurate the resulting actions will be.

Computers program themselves, to some degree, using such algorithms. They function as engineers who can design new computer responses, in response to the information provided through their interface or other means. All new data becomes a new algorithm, and the more data, the more complexity and calculation effectiveness the computer system can provide.

The key to the capacity of a Machine Learning system lies in the construction and adaptation of decision trees based on the data previously known by the system.

But the application of heuristic formulas in the nodes that make up the tree, for which a system of inferences is elaborated, also influences.

### Types of machine learning

##### Supervised learning

This type of learning is based on what is known as training information. The system is trained by providing it with a certain amount of data, defining it in detail with labels. For example, let's give the computer pictures of cats and dogs with labels that define them as such.

Once you have been provided with a sufficient amount of such data, new data can be entered without the need for labels, based on different patterns that have been recorded during training. This system is known as classification.

##### Unsupervised learning

No true values ​​or labels are used in this type of learning. These systems are intended to directly understand and abstract information patterns. This is a model of the problem known as clustering. It is a training method more similar to the way humans process information.

##### Reinforcement learning

In the reinforcement learning technique, systems learn from experience. As an example you can observe the behavior of an autonomous car. When the vehicle makes a wrong decision, it is penalized, within a system of securities registration. Through this system of rewards and punishments, the vehicle develops a more effective way of carrying out its tasks.

It is a technique based on trial and error, and on the use of reward functions that optimize the behavior of the system. It is one of the most interesting ways of learning for Artificial Intelligence systems, since the introduction of a large amount of information is not required.
