# Data_Mining
practices performed for the data mining class

### Unit_1 Branch
This is the Unit 1 Branch, where we can find the work done for the data mining class

###
Practice 2 wass addes to repository

##
Practice 3 was added to branch so programming partner can continuie

In this practice, we learn what kind of functions the R programming language can offer, we needed to find and show how 20 functions worked, many of them ar arithmetic based meaning that is used to format number results based on how we want to show them.

Some examples:

## 3. abs() Takes the absolute value of x
x <- -55
abs(x)

Result
[1] 55

#4. log(x, base=y) Takes the logarithm of x with base y; if base is not specified, returns the natural logarithm

x <-6
y <-10
log(x,base=y)

Result 

> log(x,base=y)
[1] 0.7781513

#5. exp() Returns the exponential of x
x <85
exp(x)

Result
> exp(x)
[1] 403.4288

#13. multi arguments function
times <- function(x,y) {
  x*y
}
times(2,4)

> times(2,4)
[1] 8

##18. paste() function To combine vectors after converting them to characters
paste(1,"sam",2,"rob",3,"max", sep = ',')

> paste(1,"sam",2,"rob",3,"max", sep = ',')
[1] "1,sam,2,rob,3,max"


This is some of the 20 examples of the functions that we have to research and understand how it works

in conclusion, the R programming language has a lot of useful features regarding data analysis that we can take advantage of
